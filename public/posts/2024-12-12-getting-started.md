# Getting Started with Fly.io

Deploying your first application on Fly.io is an exciting step towards modern cloud deployment. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A Fly.io account (it's free to start!)
- The `flyctl` command-line utility installed
- A basic application ready to deploy

## Installation Steps

1. First, install the Fly.io CLI:
   ```bash
   # On macOS
   brew install flyctl
   
   # On Linux
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Authenticate with your Fly.io account:
   ```bash
   flyctl auth login
   ```

## Your First Deployment

The simplest way to get started is with a static website. Create a new directory with an `index.html` file and follow these steps:

1. Initialize your Fly.io app:
   ```bash
   flyctl launch
   ```

2. Deploy your changes:
   ```bash
   flyctl deploy
   ```

And just like that, your site is live on Fly.io's global infrastructure!

## Next Steps

- Explore Fly.io's documentation for more advanced features
- Set up continuous deployment with GitHub Actions
- Add custom domains to your application

Remember, Fly.io's support team and community are always available to help if you get stuck!
